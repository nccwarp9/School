# School,
for most students is a stressful place. School
consists mostly of tests, quizzes, and interaction with other
students and adults each with different goal in mind.
SCHOOL. uses GSR or Galvanic Skin Response
to measure the level of stress, nervousness or general
alertness of students. The GSR approach to stress detection
device have shown ability to detects whether there has
been an effort or a different situation from being relaxed
with a success rate of 90.97%. To supplement detection
temperature, accelerometer and heart rate sensor can be
added.

SCHOOL. is a arm band type device that presents
it self and functions like a smart watch to students. Device
is primarily low power bluetooth device that is set up to
automatically connect to predetermine bluetooth access
points making each classroom isolated from each other
and making device itself protected from intrusion.
Device provides information in real-time or near real
time (depending on desired resolution and battery options)
to teachers about state of attention for each student in
class and enabling them to dedicate more time for specific
student or if specific topic needs more time to be properly
adopted by students.

SCHOOL. enables students to enhance their
cognitive capabilities such as focus, ability to ignore
distractions, minimizing impuslivity. There is significant
percentage of students that are dealing with mental
health issues like ADHD, autism, dyslexia and other. This
technology can help them significantly diminish their
symptoms

This results in reducing the symptoms of ADHD,
autism, dyslexia or stress.
